# thegraph-push-tour
The Graph repository for students to submit their projects during the Push Protocol Campus Tour

The Graph is the indexing and query layer of web3. Developers build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL. The Graph currently supports indexing data from over 40 different networks including Ethereum, NEAR, Arbitrum, Optimism, ZkSync, Polygon, Avalanche, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam, IPFS, Cosmos Hub and PoA with more networks coming soon. Tens of thousands of developers use The Graph for applications such as Uniswap, Synthetix, KnownOrigin, Art Blocks, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Audius, Decentraland, and many others.

The Graph, the leading decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, is thrilled to announce this initiative with Push Protocol to foster innovation within the student developer community. With a mission to make decentralized applications more efficient and accessible, we are encouraging students like you to explore, learn, and contribute to The Graph ecosystem by building new subgraphs or showcasing exceptional projects that utilize existing subgraphs.
